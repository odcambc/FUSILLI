# MultiQC Configuration for FUSILLI
# This configuration enhances MultiQC integration for standard tools
# (FastQC, BBDuk, BBMerge) and prepares for custom FUSILLI modules.

# Report title template
# Note: MultiQC will use the experiment name from the directory structure
report_title: "FUSILLI QC Report"

# Module order - standard tools first, custom modules will be added in Phase 2
module_order:
  - fastqc
  - bbduk
  - bbmerge

# FastQC settings
fastqc:
  # Extract key statistics for general stats table
  extract_stats: true

# BBDuk settings
# MultiQC automatically detects BBDuk histogram files when they match known patterns
# The histogram files (qhist, bhist, gchist, aqhist, lhist) are now included
# in the MultiQC inputs and will be automatically parsed
bbduk:
  # MultiQC's BBDuk module will automatically detect and parse histogram files
  # when they are present in the input directory

# BBMerge settings
bbmerge:
  # Extract additional statistics from insert size histogram (ihist) files
  extract_ihist_stats: true

# Table columns to display in general stats
# These will be populated by the respective modules
table_columns:
  # FastQC columns
  - "Total Sequences"
  - "Sequence length"
  - "%GC"
  # BBMerge columns
  - "Merged Reads"
  # FUSILLI-specific columns (will be added in Phase 2)
  # - "Detection Efficiency"
  # - "Coverage Fraction"
  # - "Shannon Diversity"

# Default plot settings
plot_settings:
  # Use interactive plots
  interactive: true
  # Default plot format
  format: "png"
